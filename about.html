		<p> <strong>put 'orange' and 'banana' together and you get Orangeana!</strong> </p>
		<p> that's weird. why do that? Orangeana symbolizes a questioning of our most basic assumptions. </p>
		<p> the fact that we call oranges the combination of letters/sounds 'oranges' is arbitrary, we could have called oranges bananas back in the day. </p>
		<p> point being, if we all reflect on the things we take for granted, that somebody long ago decided was how things should be done, maybe we can change them for the better. </p>
		<p> Orangeana is just here to pose the questions, you have to come up with the answers.</p>
		<p> thought provoking, we hope. </p>
