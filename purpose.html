		<p class="bold"> to provoke meaningful thought. </p>
		<p> things are complicated. so it's hard to really answer even basic questions about our lives. </p>
		<p>	ie: where does your toilet paper come from? </p>
		<p>	we're not talking about the supermarket.</p>
		<p class="borderbottom"> how does it get to the supermarket? how is it packaged? produced? how about the materials used for production? or the people involved?</p>
		<p class="bold">see how deep we got, just asking about some tp?</p>
		<p> that's the purpose here, to inspire thoughts not usually had about everyday stuff.</p>
		<p> we think it's a worthwhile endeavor and hopefully you do too. happy thinking. </p>
